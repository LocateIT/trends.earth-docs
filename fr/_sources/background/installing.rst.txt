Installing the toolbox
=============================

There are different ways to install LDMS, depending on whether you want 
to install the stable version (recommended) or the development version.

Installing the development version (recommended)
------------------------------------------------
To install from within QGIS, first launch QGIS, and then go to `Plugins` in the 
menu bar at the top of the program and select `Manage and install plugins`.
