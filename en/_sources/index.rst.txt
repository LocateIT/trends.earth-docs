**Monitor land change**

LDMS is a platform for monitoring land change using earth observations in an innovative desktop 
and cloud-based system.

**Track achievement of the sustainable development goals**

The three sub-indicators for monitoring achievement of Land Degradation 
Neutrality (LDN, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 15.3), are supported 
by LDMS: productivity, land cover, and soil organic carbon.  The tool 
also supports countries in analyzing data to prepare for their reporting
committments to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD).

LDMS allows users to plot time series of key indicators of land change 
(including degradation and improvement), to produce maps and other graphics 
that can support monitoring and reporting, and to track the impact of
sustainable land management or other projects.
