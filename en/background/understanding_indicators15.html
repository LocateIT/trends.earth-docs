<span id="indicator-15-3-1"></span><h1>SDG Indicator 15.3.1<a class="headerlink" href="#sdg-indicator-15-3-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As part of the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 15 is to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse
land degradation and halt biodiversity loss”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Each SDG has specific targets addressing different components, in this case, of
life on land. Target 15.3 aims to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including
land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve
a land degradation-neutral world”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Indicators will be used then to assess the progress of each SDG target. In the
case of SDG 15.3 the progress towards a land degradation neutral world will be
assessed using indicator 15.3.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As the custodian agency for SDG 15.3, the United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification (UNCCD) has developed a <a class="reference external" href="http://www2.unccd.int/sites/default/files/relevant-links/2017-10/Good%20Practice%20Guidance_SDG%20Indicator%2015.3.1_Version%201.0.pdf">Good Practice Guidance (GPG)</a>.
providing recommendations on how to calculate SDG Indicator 15.3.1.</p>
<p>This document provides a brief introduction to SDG Indicator 15.3.1 and
describes how each indicator is calculated by LDMS.</p>
<p>In order to assess the area degraded, SDG Indicator 15.3.1 uses information
from 3 sub-indicators:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Vegetation productivity</p></li>
<li><p>Land cover</p></li>
<li><p>Soil organic carbon</p></li>
</ol>
<img alt="../_images/indicator_15_3_1.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/indicator_15_3_1.png" />
<p>LDMS allows the user to compute each of these subindicators in a
spatially explicit way generating raster maps which are then integrated into a
final SDG 15.3.1 indicator map and produces a table result reporting areas
potentially improved and degraded for the area of analysis.</p>
<div class="section" id="sub-indicators">
<h2>Sub-indicators<a class="headerlink" href="#sub-indicators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="productivity">
<span id="indicator-productivity"></span><h3>Productivity<a class="headerlink" href="#productivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Land productivity is the biological productive capacity of the land, the source
of all the food, fiber and fuel that sustains humans (United Nations
Statistical Commission 2016). Net primary productivity (NPP) is the net amount
of carbon assimilated after photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration over a
given period of time (Clark et al. 2001) and is typically represented in units
such as kg/ha/yr. NPP is a variable time consuming and costly to estimate, for
that reason, we rely on remotely sensed information to derive indicators of
NPP.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used surrogates of NPP is the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI), computed using information from the red and near
infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In LDMS we make
use of bi-weekly products from MODIS and AVHRR to compute annual integrals of
NDVI (computed as the mean annual NDVI for simplicity of interpretation of
results). These annual integrals of NDVI are then used to compute each of the
productivity indicators explained below.</p>
<p>Land productivity is assessed in LDMS using three measures of change
derived from NDVI time series data: trajectory, performance and state</p>
<img alt="../_images/indicator_15_3_1_prod_subindicators.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/indicator_15_3_1_prod_subindicators.png" />
<div class="section" id="productivity-trajectory">
<span id="indicator-productivity-trajectory"></span><h4>Productivity Trajectory<a class="headerlink" href="#productivity-trajectory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Trajectory measures the rate of change in primary productivity over time. As
indicated in the figure below, LDMS computes a linear regression at
the pixel level to identify areas experiencing changes in primary productivity
for the period under analysis. A Mann-Kendall non-paremetric significance test
is then applied, considering only significant changes those that show a p-value
≤ 0.05. Positive significant trends in NDVI would indicate potential
improvement in land condition, and negative significant trends potential
degradation.</p>
<img alt="../_images/lp_traj_flow.PNG" class="align-center" src="../_images/lp_traj_flow.PNG" />
<div class="section" id="correcting-for-the-effects-of-climate">
<span id="indicator-productivity-climate-correction"></span><h5>Correcting for the effects of climate<a class="headerlink" href="#correcting-for-the-effects-of-climate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Within a given ecosystem, primary productivity is affected by several factors,
such as temperature, and the availability of light, nutrients and water. Of
those, water availability is the most variable over time, and can have very
significant influences in the amount of plant tissue produced every year. When
annual integrals of NDVI are used to perform the trajectory analysis, it is
important to interpret the results having historical precipitation information
as a context. Otherwise, declining productivity trends could be identified as
human caused land degradation, when they are driven by regional patterns of
changes in water availability.</p>
<p>LDMS allows the user to perform different types of analysis to
separate the climatic causes of the changes in primary productivity, from those
which could be a consequence of human land use decisions on the ground. The
methods currently supported for climate corrections are:</p>
<p><strong>Residual Trend Analysis (RESTREND):</strong> RESTREND uses linear regression models
to predict NDVI for a given rainfall amount. Trends in the difference between
the predicted NDVI and the observed NDVI (the residual) are interpreted as
non-climatically related productivity change. Please refer to the following
citation more more details on the method and its limitations: <cite>Wessels, K.J.;
van den Bergh, F.; Scholes, R.J. Limits to detectability of land degradation by
trend analysis of vegetation index data. Remote Sens. Environ. 2012, 125,
10–22.</cite></p>
<p><strong>Rain Use Efficiency (RUE):</strong> RUE Is the ratio of annual NPP to annual
precipitation. LDMS uses the annual integrals of NDVI as a proxy for
annual NPP, and offers the possibility of choosing among different
precipitation products to compute RUE. After RUE is computed for each of the
years under analysis, a linear regression and a non-parametric significance
test is applied to the trend of RUE over time. Positive significant trends in
RUE would indicate potential improvement in land condition, and negative
significant trends potential degradation. Please refer to the following
publication for details on the methods and its limitations: <cite>Wessels, K.J.;
Prince, S.D.; Malherbe, J.; Small, J.; Frost, P.E.; VanZyl, D. Can
human-induced land degradation be distinguished from the effects of rainfall
variability? A case study in South Africa. J. Arid Environ. 2007, 68, 271–297.</cite></p>
<p><strong>Water Use Efficiency (WUE):</strong> RUE assumes that there is a linear relationship
between the amount of water that falls in the form of precipitation in a
particular place and the amount of water which will be actually used by the
plants. This assumption does not hold true for every system. WUE tries to
address this limitation by using total annual evapo-transpiration (ET) instead
precipitation. ET is defined as precipitation minus the water lost to surface
runoff, recharge to groundwater and changes to soil water storage. The rest of
the analysis follows as described for RUE: a linear regression and a
non-parametric significance test is applied to the trend of WUE over time.
Positive significant trends in WUE would indicate potential improvement in land
condition, and negative significant trends potential degradation.</p>

trend analysis over time using the original NDVI data or with climatic
corrections:</p>

<div class="section" id="productivity-state">
<span id="indicator-productivity-state"></span><h4>Productivity State<a class="headerlink" href="#productivity-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Productivity State indicator allows for the detection of recent changes in
primary productivity as compared to a baseline period. The indicator is
computed as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Define the baseline period (historical period to which to compare recent
primary productivity).</p></li>
<li><p>Define the comparison period (recent years used to compute comparison). It
is recommended to use a 3-year to avoid annual fluctuations related to
climate.</p></li>
<li><p>For each pixel, use the annual integrals of NDVI for the baseline period to
compute a frequency distribution. In case the baseline period missed some
extreme values in NDVI, add 5% on both extremes of the distribution. That
expanded frequency distribution curve is then used to define the cut-off
values of the 10 percentile classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the mean NDVI for the baseline period, and determine the percentile
class it belongs to. Assign to the mean NDVI for the baseline period the
number corresponding to that percentile class. Possible values range from 1
(lowest class) to 10 (highest class).</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the mean NDVI for the comparison period, and determine the
percentile class it belongs to. Assign to the mean NDVI for the comparison
period the number corresponding to that percentile class. Possible values
range from 1 (lowest class) to 10 (highest class).</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the difference in class number between the comparison and the
baseline period (comparison minus baseline).</p></li>
<li><p>If the difference in class between the baseline and the comparison period is
≤ 2, then that pixel could potentially be degraded. If the difference is ≥
2, that pixel would indicate a recent improvement in terms of primary
productivity. Pixels with small changes are considered stable.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="productivity-performance">
<span id="indicator-productivity-performance"></span><h4>Productivity Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#productivity-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Productivity Performance indicator measures local productivity relative to
other similar vegetation types in similar land cover types or bioclimatic
regions throughout the study area. LDMS uses the unique combination
of soil units (soil taxonomy units using USDA system provided by SoilGrids at
250m resolution) and land cover (full 37 land cover classes provided by ESA CCI
at 300m resolution) to define this areas of analysis. The indicator is computed
as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Define the analysis period, and use the time series of NDVI to compute mean
the NDVI for each pixel.</p></li>
<li><p>Define similar ecologically similar units as the unique intersection of land
cover and soil type.</p></li>
<li><p>For each unit, extract all the mean NDVI values computed in step 1, and
create a frequency distribution. From this distribution determine the value
which represents the 90th   percentile (we don’t recommend using the
absolute maximum NDVI value to avoid possible errors due to the presence of
outliers). The value representing the 90th percentile will be considered the
maximum productivity for that unit.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the ratio of mean NDVI and maximum productivity (in each case
compare the mean observed value to the maximum for its corresponding unit).</p></li>
<li><p>If observed mean NDVI is lower than 50% than the maximum productivity, that
pixel is considered potentially degraded for this indicator.</p></li>

<p>The three productivity sub-indicators are then combined as indicated in the
tables below. For SDG 15.3.1 reporting, the 3-class indicator is required, but
LDMS also produces a 5-class one which takes advantage of the
information provided by State to inform the type of degradation occurring in
the area.</p>

<div class="section" id="land-cover">
<span id="indicator-land-cover"></span><h3>Land cover<a class="headerlink" href="#land-cover" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To assess changes in land cover users need land cover maps covering the study
area for the baseline and target years. These maps need to be of acceptable
accuracy and created in such a way which allows for valid comparisons.
LDMS uses ESA CCI land cover maps as the default dataset, but local
maps can also be used. The indicator is computed as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Reclassify both land cover maps to the 7 land cover classes needed for
reporting to the UNCCD (forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, artificial
area, bare land and water).</p></li>
<li><p>Perform a land cover transition analysis to identify which pixels remained
in the same land cover class, and which ones changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your local knowledge of the conditions in the study area and the
land degradation processed occurring there, use the table below to identify
which transitions correspond to degradation (- sign), improvement (+ sign),
or no change in terms of land condition (zero).</p></li>
</ol>
<img alt="../_images/lc_matrix.PNG" class="align-center" src="../_images/lc_matrix.PNG" />
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>LDMS will combine the information from the land cover maps and the
table of degradation typologies by land cover transition to compute the land
cover sub-indicator.</p></li>
</ol>
<img alt="../_images/lc_flow.PNG" class="align-center" src="../_images/lc_flow.PNG" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="soil-organic-carbon">
<span id="indicator-soc"></span><h3>Soil organic carbon<a class="headerlink" href="#soil-organic-carbon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The third sub-indicator for monitoring land degradation as part of the SDG
process quantifies changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) over the reporting
period. Changes in SOC are particularly difficult to assess for several
reasons, some of them being the high spatial variability of soil properties,
the time and cost intensiveness of conducting representative soil surveys and
the lack of time series data on SOC for most regions of the world. To address
some of the limitations, a combined land cover/SOC method is used in
LDMS to estimate changes in SOC and identify potentially degraded
areas. The indicator is computed as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Determine the SOC reference values. LDMS uses SoilGrids 250m
carbon stocks for the first 30 cm of the soil profile as the reference
values for calculation (NOTE: SoilGrids uses information from a variety of
data sources and ranging from many years to produce this product, therefore
assigning a date for calculations purposes could cause inaccuracies in the
stock change calculations).</p></li>
<li><p>Reclassify the land cover maps to the 7 land cover classes needed for
reporting to the UNCCD (forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, artificial
area, bare land and water). Ideally annual land cover maps are preferred,
but at least land cover maps for the starting and end years are needed.</p></li>
<li><p>To estimate the changes in C stocks for the reporting period C conversion
coefficients for changes in land use, management and inputs are recommended
by the IPCC and the UNCCD. However, spatially explicit information on
management and C inputs is not available for most regions. As such, only
land use conversion coefficient can be applied for estimating changes in C
stocks (using land cover as a proxy for land use). The coefficients used
were the result of a literature review performed by the UNCCD and are
presented in the table below. Those coefficients represent the proportional
in C stocks after 20 years of land cover change.</p></li>
</ol>
<img alt="../_images/soc_coeff.PNG" class="align-center" src="../_images/soc_coeff.PNG" />
<p>Changes in SOC are better studied for land cover transitions involving
agriculture, and for that reason there is a different set of coefficients for
each of the main global climatic regions: Temperate Dry (f = 0.80), Temperate
Moist (f = 0.69), Tropical Dry (f = 0.58), Tropical Moist (f = 0.48), and
Tropical Montane (f = 0.64).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Compute relative different in SOC between the baseline and the target
period, areas which experienced a loss in SOC of 10% of more during the
reporting period will be considered potentially degraded, and areas
experiencing a gain of 10% or more as potentially improved.</p></li>

<p>The integration of the three SDG 15.3.1 sub-indicators is done following the
